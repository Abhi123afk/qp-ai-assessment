With my skill set spanning deep learning techniques such as CNNs and RNNs to traditional machine learning algorithms like decision trees and SVMs, I possess a well-rounded expertise in data analysis and modeling. Proficient in frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Streamlit, coupled with a strong command over Python, I am adept at implementing robust, scalable end-to-end solutions in various domains. My familiarity with cloud platforms like AWS and databases such as SQL, alongside auxiliary skills like Git and Docker, enables me to develop and deploy solutions efficiently across different environments.

In my role at Konverge.AI, I led transformative projects showcasing my expertise in machine learning and AI technologies. From developing a Generative AI-based Quotation Generator, integrating Azure Form Recognizer and OpenAI's Turbo 3.5 model, to creating a Football Highlights Compiler using TensorFlow, achieving an 86% accuracy rate with LSTM models. Additionally, I spearheaded the AI Showcase Hub, a versatile platform demonstrating our organization's capabilities with integrated projects utilizing AWS, SpaCy, and face recognition. These experiences underscore my ability to deliver impactful solutions through innovative application of cutting-edge technologies.
